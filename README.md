# Project2018-iris

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
This famous iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
 
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes -

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. Species: 
-- Iris Setosa 
-- Iris Versicolour 
-- Iris Virginica

## Libraries Used
Importing the libaries for this project: Pandas, Numpy, Holoviews.

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple.

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

I also used the Jupyter Notebook for this project. 

## 1. Data Import
Import the iris.csv using the panda library and examine first few rows of data

## 2. Discovering the Shape of the table

## 3. Find out unique classification/type of iris flower and the amount
'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor', 'Iris-virginica'

## 4. Investigating the data: Min, Max, Mean, Median and Standard Deviation

## 5. Summary Statistics Table
From the above summary, we can see there is huge range in the size of the Sepal Length and Petal Length. We will use a scatter plot to see if the size is related to the species of Iris.
